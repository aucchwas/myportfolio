# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my dynamic, responsive personal portfolio website. This project showcases my ability to build modern, scalable web applications that balance performance, SEO friendliness, and user experience. Utilizing React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts, this website is a testament to my skills in front-end development and software architecture.

## Features

- **React.js and Next.js**: Leveraging the power of React.js for a component-based architecture and Next.js for server-side rendering to ensure an optimal balance between performance, SEO, and user experience.
- **TypeScript (TSX)**: Utilization of TypeScript for creating flexible, reusable components, ensuring type safety across the application which enhances maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Application of Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development without sacrificing customizability or design principles, ensuring the creation of visually appealing and user-centric interfaces.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Incorporation of DDD concepts like entities, value objects, aggregates, and domain events to architect the applicationâ€™s business logic layer, facilitating a maintainable and extensible codebase.
